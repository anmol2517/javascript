## Learn To Study >> Type Conversion

>>  In JavaScript, null is a primitive value. However, typeof returns "object".
>>  This is a well-known bug in JavaScript and has historical reasons.

## Learn To Study >> typeof Operator
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-typeof-operator

>>  The `typeof` operator in JavaScript returns a string indicating the type of the operand, such as `"string"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`, `"object"`, `"function"`, `"undefined"`, or `"symbol"`.

The old method of concatenation (`name + repoCount + " Value"`) is less readable, so we use template literals with backticks (`) and `${}` for cleaner, modern string interpolation.

```
The old method of concatenation (name + repoCount + " Value") is less readable
const.log (name + repoCount + " Value");

Use backticks () with ${variable}` for string interpolation in JavaScript to inject variables directly into strings.
console.log(hello this side ${name} or rc is ${repoCount}); 
```
