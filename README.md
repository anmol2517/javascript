## Learn To Study >> Type Conversion
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-type-conversion

>>  In JavaScript, null is a primitive value. However, typeof returns "object".
>>  This is a well-known bug in JavaScript and has historical reasons.

## Learn To Study >> typeof Operator
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-typeof-operator

>>  The `typeof` operator in JavaScript returns a string indicating the type of the operand, such as `"string"`, `"number"`, `"boolean"`, `"object"`, `"function"`, `"undefined"`, or `"symbol"`.


## Learn To Study >> String Declaration 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String

The old method of concatenation (`name + repoCount + " Value"`) is less readable, so we use template literals with backticks (`) and `${}` for cleaner, modern string interpolation.

```
>> const.log (name + repoCount + " Value");
>> console.log(hello this side ${name} or rc is ${repoCount}); 
```
